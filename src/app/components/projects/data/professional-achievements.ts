Currently the components are completely stable and are being used daily by thousands of users. After the launch of the new design system, we carried out an internal research, which demonstrated that the majority of developers realized that their projects gained more than 50% agility on the process of creating a new interface.',        imageSrc: [            '/professional-achievements/design-system/home.png'        ],        imageAlt: 'Design system Project',        githubLink: null,        productionLink: 'https://falcon-ds.magazord.com.br/',        tools: [            'ReactJS',            'Typescript',            'Storybook',            'Tailwind CSS',            'Shadcn',        ]    },    {        title: 'Design Central',        description: 'Application developed to centralize legacy interfaces present on our e-commerce platform.

This application is currently being used by approximately 2500 customers and the main tools used during development were ReactJS, React Query and TailwindCSS and Cypress for testing.

We currently have approximately 2100 of our customers using the new order view, this application has been in production for about a year and has received several positive feedbacks. The application was developed using ReactJS and TailwindCSS. One challenge I had in this project was managing the development of an API from scratch to provide data related to the order together with the back-end team. In this project, it is important to highlight that it was the first time that I applied micro-frontend architecture techniques, since this application runs within the system\'s old platform interface. After the screen was released, some research was carried out, which resulted in some positive indicators, such as 90% of users found it easier to find information in the new interface compared to the old one.',        imageSrc: [],        imageAlt: 'Order View Interface Project',        githubLink: null,        productionLink: null,        tools: []    },    {        title: 'New Product Layouts',        description: 'aaa',        imageSrc: [            '/professional-achievements/product-layouts/modelo-12.png',            '/professional-achievements/product-layouts/modelo-11.png',            '/professional-achievements/product-layouts/modelo-10.png'        ],        imageAlt: 'New Product Layouts Project',        githubLink: null,        productionLink: null,        tools: [            'ReactJS',            'Typescript',            'Tailwind CSS',            'Vite',        ]    },    {        title: 'Gift List',        description: 'Interface for creating and managing a gift list in ours customers websites.
